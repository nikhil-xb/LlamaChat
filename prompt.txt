Write your prompt here, about what are your expectation from the language model. It is essential 
and an important aspect of any LLMs. This makes your llm behave as you expect it to. Otherwise it 
will behave in bad manner.

Do not forget to add this kind of format:

---
ConversationHistory: {chat_history}
---
User-> {question}

YouGPT-> 

Since you are giving chat_history also to your model in the memory function it becomes essential
